# MEVN Music Tab Tracker App

This repository contains a full-stack **SEVN** (SQLite, Express.js, Vue.js, Node.js) application that I built while learning the Vue.js frontend development framework. The app allows users to browse, search, and save guitar tablature for their favorite songs.

## Features

-   **User Authentication:** Implements user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure login and registration.
-   **Tab Management:** Users can browse and search for guitar tabs, view tab details, and save tabs to their profile for later access.
-   **Responsive Design:** Utilizes responsive design principles to ensure optimal user experience across various devices.
-   **Database Integration:** Integrates with a SQLite file to store user data and tab information.
